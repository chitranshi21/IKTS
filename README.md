IKTS(I Know This Shop) - is an app (with all its backend glory)
 that allows you to browse and buy products from your local
  shop

## Documentation

[Documentation](https://linktodocumentation)
This repository will include all project and
integration components to successfully build and run the app
in your server. The intention is to use open source projects
and depend on minimum external services that hide away the
complexity. We would also try to be as cloud agnostic as possible
(although truth be told there is nothing as complete cloud agnostic)
